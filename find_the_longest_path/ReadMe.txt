Sequencing machines cannot currently read the full length of a gene or genome. Computational biologist must assemble these shorter reads into the full gene or genome using in silico methods. This program is an exercise in understanding how to assemble a sequence from a directed graph where the edges of the graph each have unique weights, which can be applied to the process of assembling a genome.

This program provides the starting and ending points for the path and assumes that we would like to find the longest path through a directed graph---the path through the directed graph where the sum of all the edges' weights is the largest. The program returns the longest path through the directed graph and the sum of all of the weights of the traversed edges.
